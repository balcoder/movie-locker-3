## Movielocker

This is a movie SPA built using React and using [The Movie Database  API](https://www.themoviedb.org/). My aim with
this app was to create a place to search and browse for movies new and old using real data from the movie database,
providing some overview information with links to trailers and rating.

## Main Features

Browse popular movies on startup, search for movies by partial title or full, filter by genre and filter by upcoming,
in cinema or top rated. Get brief description of the movie and link to the trailer on youtube.

* uses PropTypes for type checking
* async await and fetch for loading dynamic data from movie database
* react-router-dom for the links, switch and routing
* react-reveal for the zoom effets
* bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
